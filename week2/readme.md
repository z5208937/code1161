TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Today I had a pretty easy time with most of the exercises,however exercise 3 was definitely much more difficult that the other exercises. Looping was very difficult to learn and apply without the help of my fellow classmates and tutors. The pyrimad loops was the most difficult in my opinion during the entire week 2 exercise.
